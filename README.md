# Hyrax::Autopopulation

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hyrax-autopopulation'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle exec rails g hyrax:autopopulation:install
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install hyrax-autopopulation
```

For Hyrax engine.rb does the include but if you are using Hyku or HykuAddons then include the module below into the files shown in order
to add the property :autopopulation_status:
````ruby
 include Hyrax::Autopopulation::AutopopulationProperty
````

into the following files:

https://github.com/ubiquitypress/hyku_addons/blob/main/app/models/concerns/hyku_addons/work_base.rb

https://github.com/ubiquitypress/hyku_addons/blob/main/app/models/concerns/hyku_addons/schema/work_base.rb

Also for Hyku & HykuAddons users only include:

```ruby
  include Hyrax::Autopopulation::SolrDocumentBehavior
```

https://github.com/ubiquitypress/hyku_addons/blob/main/app/models/concerns/hyku_addons/solr_document_behavior.rb

## Development

When cloning, you will need to bring in the Hyrax submodule by:

```bash
cd spec/internal_test_hyku;
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

Then you can build the application from the root folder (`cd ../../`):

```bash
docker-compose up --build web
```
